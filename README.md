#  Vehicle Perception System

A modular deep learning–based perception pipeline for autonomous driving.  
This project integrates object detection, lane detection, and vehicle tracking into one cohesive framework.

---

##  Features

- **Vehicle Detection** – powered by YOLO (real-time detection)
- **Lane Detection** – robust edge- and CNN-based lane line recognition
- **Object Tracking** – implemented with SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)
- **Scalable Design** – easy to extend with more sensors or perception modules

| Component | Framework / Tool |
|------------|------------------|
| Object Detection | YOLOv8 / OpenCV |
| Tracking | SORT |
| Lane Detection | Python + NumPy + OpenCV |
| Visualization | Matplotlib / OpenCV |
| Environment | Python 3.10+, Anaconda, Git |
